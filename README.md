# 🚀 Mars Recycling System (MRS)

## 1️⃣ Executive Summary

The **Mars Recycling System (MRS)** is a comprehensive solution designed to transform **83% of inorganic waste** generated during a three-year Mars mission into useful products for the crew.  

- **Estimated input:** 12,600 kg of waste  
- **Recovered materials:** 10,458 kg  
- **Reduction in Earth resupply:** 60%  
- **Production output:** 25,576 reusable items  
- **Crew time required:** 6 hours/week ⏱️  
- **Estimated savings:** $9.5M 💰  

MRS combines six complementary technological processes (**thermal, mechanical, fiber, chemical, carbon, and additive**) to optimize efficiency, minimize energy and water consumption, and maximize mission sustainability.

## 2️⃣ Context and Justification

During a **manned mission to Mars**, waste management becomes critical:  

- Transporting extra resources from Earth or returning waste is **expensive and inefficient**.  
- Over a three-year mission with eight astronauts, **12.6 tons of inorganic waste** would accumulate, threatening health, logistics, and sustainability.  

MRS addresses NASA’s challenge by creating a **circular and sustainable system** that enables long-term exploration on Mars and beyond 🌌.

## 3️⃣ Technical Description

MRS is a **modular and automated platform** with a 4-phase pipeline:

### 🔹 Input & Sorting
- Automatic sorting of waste into: plastics, textiles, metals, carbon products, foams, and composites.

### 🔹 Multimodal Processing (6 units)
1. **Thermal ♨️**: decomposition and melting of plastics  
2. **Mechanical ⚙️**: crushing and reuse of metals and rigid components  
3. **Fiber 🧵**: reprocessing of textiles and fibrous materials  
4. **Chemical ⚗️**: recovery of specific compounds using safe solutions  
5. **Carbon 🪨**: conversion of carbon-based products into structural materials  
6. **Additive 🖨️**: 3D printing of tools and components from recycled materials

### 🔹 Production
- Over **25,500 items**, including structural materials, daily-use utensils, habitat elements, and scientific kits.

### 🔹 Sustainable Outputs 🌱
- All by-products are **recycled or stored without toxic emissions**, maximizing resource use.

## 5️⃣ Feasibility 🛠️

MRS is developed in phases:

1. **Terrestrial prototype (TRL 4-5)**: validation of six integrated processes  
2. **Analog environment testing** (Moon/Mars simulants): energy and water efficiency optimization  
3. **Orbital validation**: testing in short-duration missions  
4. **Martian deployment (TRL 8-9)**: implementation in a crewed habitat  

- **Estimated initial investment:** $30M  
- **Payback period:** 2.8 years  
- **Estimated ROI:** 340% compared to Earth resupply 💸
